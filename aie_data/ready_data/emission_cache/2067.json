No explicit emission peak for aggregated state is reported. The paper discusses aggregation in THF/water mixtures (Figure 3) but does not provide a specific peak wavelength for the aggregate state of TPBCzC2; it only states a range (409-422 nm) for the series. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null. Emission_solid_or_film_nm is extracted from Table 1 and Figure 2B for the vacuum-deposited neat film.\"\n}\n```",
