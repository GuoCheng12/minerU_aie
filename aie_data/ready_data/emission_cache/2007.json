However, no explicit emission peak wavelength for DB-TBT under aggregated conditions (e.g., THF/water mixture at high fw) is reported in the provided chunks. The paper discusses PL spectra in THF/water mixtures (Figures S2/S3) but does not provide a numerical λ_em,max for DB-TBT in the aggregated state. For solid state, Table 1 provides PLQYs and lifetimes but not the emission peak; Figure 1D shows PL spectra in solids but no numerical value is given in the text. Therefore, both required emission peaks are missing from the provided content.\"\n}\n```",
