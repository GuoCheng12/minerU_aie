While Figure 3 shows PL spectra of PPPO in CH3CN/water mixtures with varying water fractions (fw), indicating aggregation-induced emission (AIE), the specific emission peak wavelength for the aggregated state (e.g., at high fw like 99%) is not numerically stated in the provided text or table. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm must be set to null per the anti-leakage rule, as no explicit aggregate emission peak value is given.\"\n}\n```",
