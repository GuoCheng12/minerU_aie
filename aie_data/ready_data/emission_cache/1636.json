However, no explicit emission peak wavelength for TPB under aggregated-state conditions (e.g., THF/water mixture with high fw) is reported in the provided chunks. The text mentions TPB's emission is quenched in aggregates and a small new peak at 618 nm appears at fw > 70%, but this is not clearly stated as the emission maximum of the aggregate itself. For solid/film, while quantum yields in solid state are mentioned (Table S1), no specific emission peak wavelength for solid state or film is provided for TPB in the given content.\"\n}\n```",
