However, no explicit emission peak wavelength (in nm) is provided for either aggregated-state or solid/film conditions. The PL spectra in THF/water mixtures are discussed (e.g., peaks at 458 and 478 nm in THF, and emission enhancement/quenching with water fraction), but no single 'emission maximum' value is reported for the aggregated state (e.g., at fw=70% where nanoaggregates form). Similarly, while the crystal state is mentioned and its quantum yield given, no emission peak wavelength for the crystal or solid state is explicitly stated in the provided chunks. Therefore, both required emission values cannot be extracted and are set to null.\"\n}\n```",
