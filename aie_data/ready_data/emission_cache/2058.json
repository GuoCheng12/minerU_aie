The PL spectrum is reported in Figure 1D, but the provided context only states the emission peak is at 908 nm in the NIR-II region. The condition for this measurement is not explicitly stated in the provided chunks. The full sentence from Chunk 1 is: 'the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TPA-BTDH were peaked at 908 nm in the NIR-II region (Figure 1D).' The preceding sentence mentions absorption in THF, but it is not definitively linked to the PL measurement condition. Crucially, there is no mention of aggregate conditions (e.g., THF/water mixtures, nanoaggregates) or solid/film conditions (e.g., powder, film, crystal) for the emission measurement within the provided context. Therefore, following the strict anti-leakage rule, both emission_aggr_nm and emission_solid_or_film_nm must be set to null, as the required explicit condition labels are absent.\"\n}\n```",
