However, no explicit emission peak for aggregated-state (e.g., THF/water mixture at high fw) is provided in the given chunks. The PL spectra in Figure 2A show trends but no specific λmax value is stated for aggregates. The emission at 598 nm is for 'TPE-Ph-B-doped AIE dots in water' (Figure 3D), which are nanoparticles formulated with a polymer matrix, not pure aggregates of the compound itself. No solid-state or film emission data is reported. Therefore, both required emission values are set to null per strict extraction rules.\"\n}\n```",
