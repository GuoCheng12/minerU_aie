However, no explicit emission peak values (in nm) for TP7 are provided in the given context chunks. The text discusses emission maxima for other compounds (e.g., TP1, TP2, TP5, TP8) and mentions that TP7 has red-shifted spectra and reduced ΔE_ST, but no numerical emission wavelength is stated for TP7 in aggregated state, solid, or film. Therefore, both emission fields are set to null. The anti-leakage rule prevents using values from other compounds or inferring a value from the general discussion.\"\n}\n```",
