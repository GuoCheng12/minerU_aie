However, no explicit emission peak wavelength (in nm) is reported for the target under the required strict conditions. Fig. 1A shows PL spectra in THF/hexane mixtures, but the text only states the emission maximum is at 383 nm in pure THF (a good solvent, not an aggregate condition). The strongest emission is mentioned at f_H = 99%, but no numerical peak value is given for that aggregated condition. Mentions of 'aggregates', 'NPs', and 'solid state' exist, but no corresponding emission maxima in nm are provided in the given context chunks. Therefore, both required fields must be set to null.\"\n}\n```",
