The paper states TPECNPB is weakly emissive, and upon reaction with H₂O₂, it converts to TPECNP which exhibits AIE. Emission at 625 nm is explicitly stated for TPECNP in PBS (aggregated condition after activation). Emission at 678 nm is explicitly stated for TPECNP in solid state (53 nm redshift from aggregated state). Therefore, TPECNP is the relevant emissive species derived from the target probe TPECNPB.\"\n}\n```",
