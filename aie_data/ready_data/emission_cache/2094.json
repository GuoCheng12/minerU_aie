This meets the strict definition of an explicit aggregate condition (solvent mixture causing aggregation). No explicit emission peak for solid, film, or crystal is provided in the given context. The text mentions 'intensive green emission of DBTA crystal' and 'crystal emission' but does not give a numerical wavelength value. Therefore, emission_solid_or_film_nm is set to null.\"\n}\n```",
