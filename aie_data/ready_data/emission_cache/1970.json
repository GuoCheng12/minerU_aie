However, no explicit emission peak for aggregated-state (e.g., THF/water mixture at high fw) or solid/film state is reported for TPE-T-RS. The paper reports emission in pure THF (633 nm) and for TPE-T-RS NPs in aqueous media (624 nm), but NPs are not considered an explicit aggregate condition per the strict definition (they are nanoparticles formulated with a copolymer matrix). The AIE plot (Figure 1d) discusses intensity ratios but does not provide an emission peak wavelength for the aggregated state (e.g., at fw=90%). No solid, powder, crystal, or film emission data is provided for TPE-T-RS. Therefore, both required emission fields are set to null.\"\n}\n```",
