For aggregated-state emission, the paper discusses THF/water mixtures (e.g., f_w = 80-90%) and shows a new broad peak at 350-380 nm (page 2), but no single, explicit emission maximum for the aggregate is reported in the provided text or table. The solid-state emission maximum is clearly reported as 402 nm (λ_TSC in Table 1) and confirmed in Figure 1d and narrative (page 2). Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null due to lack of an explicit peak value under aggregate conditions.\"\n}\n```",
