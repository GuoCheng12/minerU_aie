However, no explicit emission peak wavelength values are reported in the provided text chunks. Figure 1d shows emission spectra in THF/water mixtures, but the peak value is not stated numerically in the text. The text mentions an emission peak at 527 nm for TPE-BODIPY@epoxy resin in THF solution (0 vol% water), which is a solution/dispersed state, not an explicit aggregate condition. No explicit aggregate emission peak (e.g., at fw=90%) or solid/film emission peak is provided numerically. Therefore, both required emission values are set to null.\"\n}\n```",
