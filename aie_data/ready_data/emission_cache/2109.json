However, the provided context chunks only discuss photophysical properties in DMSO and water solutions, and two-photon properties. No explicit aggregate condition (e.g., THF/water mixture with high water fraction, nanoaggregate) is mentioned for emission measurement. Also, no solid-state, powder, crystal, or thin film emission data is reported in the provided excerpts. Therefore, both emission_aggr_nm and emission_solid_or_film_nm are set to null in accordance with the anti-leakage and strict extraction rules. The full paper or SI (Table S3, Fig. 2) might contain the specific emission peak values in DMSO/water, but these do not qualify as aggregated-state or solid/film emission under the strict definitions.\"\n}\n```",
