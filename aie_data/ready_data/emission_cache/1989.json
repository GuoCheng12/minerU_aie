The paper discusses AIEgens in general and mentions specific colors (blue, green, yellow, orange, red, white) corresponding to hydrogels HG-1 to HG-6, but no explicit compound labels matching 'AIE-O' are found. The target SMILES was not used for matching as the primary identity key (code/label) was not found, and the context lacks the necessary structural information (e.g., SI with compound structures, SMILES, or substituent tables) to perform a SMILES-based fallback match. Therefore, the target molecule is not found in the provided content.\"\n}\n```",
