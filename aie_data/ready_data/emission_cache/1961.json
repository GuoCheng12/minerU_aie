Table 1 provides emission data for water (544 nm), THF/water 99% (541 nm), and solid state (539 nm). While the paper discusses aggregation (e.g., Ca2+-induced fibrillar aggregates), no explicit emission peak value is reported for a defined 'aggregate' condition (e.g., THF/water mixture at a specific fraction causing aggregation without Ca2+). The THF/water 99% condition (541 nm) is a solvent mixture, but the text describes it as a mixture where the probe is still soluble/dispersed, not explicitly labeled as an aggregate condition. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per the anti-leakage rule. The solid-state emission (539 nm) is clearly reported and used for emission_solid_or_film_nm.\"\n}\n```",
