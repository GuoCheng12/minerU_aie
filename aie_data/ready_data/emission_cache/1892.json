However, no explicit emission peak values for aggregated-state conditions (e.g., THF/water mixtures at high fw, nanoaggregates) or for solid/film state (powder, crystal, spin-coated film) are reported in the provided context. The reported emission at 670 nm is for PBS solution (5 µM), which is a dilute solution condition, not an explicit aggregate condition as defined by the rules (solvent mixtures causing aggregation or explicitly labeled aggregates). Therefore, both required emission peaks are set to null.\"\n}\n```",
