Emission data is provided for solution (CH2Cl2, 494 nm) and powder (480 nm). No explicit aggregate condition (e.g., THF/water mixture, nanoaggregate, labeled 'Em(agg)') is reported. The paper discusses aggregates theoretically and mentions 'aggregated state' in Figure 6 caption, but no experimental emission peak for an explicit aggregate condition is given. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per anti-leakage rule. Emission_solid_or_film_nm is taken from the powder measurement in Table 1.\"\n}\n```",
