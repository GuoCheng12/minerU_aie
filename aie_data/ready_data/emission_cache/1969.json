However, no explicit emission peak for aggregated-state conditions (e.g., THF/water mixtures at high fw) is reported for TPE-T-RO. The paper discusses AIE properties in THF/water mixtures (Chunk 4) but provides only α_AIE values, not emission maxima for aggregates. The emission for TPE-T-RO NPs (578 nm, Chunk 2) is from nanoparticles in aqueous media, which are prepared via nanoprecipitation but are not explicitly labeled as 'aggregates' or described with the strict aggregation conditions required (e.g., solvent mixture fw). No solid-state or film emission data is reported for TPE-T-RO. Therefore, both emission fields are set to null per the strict anti-leakage rules.\"\n}\n```",
