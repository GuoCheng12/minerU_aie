An aggregate-state emission peak of 461 nm is reported for TPEPOH in Chunk 3 ('In the aggregate state, TPEPOH shows blue emission (λ_em-max = 461 nm)'). However, this value is not explicitly linked to a solvent mixture (e.g., THF/water fw) or labeled 'aggregates' in the provided chunks; it is stated as a general 'aggregate state' property, likely referring to powder or a non-solvent aggregate condition. Since the strict definition requires an explicit aggregate condition (e.g., THF/water mixture) and the provided context does not specify such a condition for the 461 nm value, emission_aggr_nm is set to null to avoid leakage. The 461 nm value is assigned to emission_solid_or_film_nm as it represents the aggregate/solid-state emission. No separate film/powder crystal value distinct from this aggregate-state value is provided.\"\n}\n```",
