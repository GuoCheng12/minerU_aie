However, while the paper extensively discusses the AIE behavior and emission of A2HPS aggregates in solvent mixtures (e.g., THF/water, acetonitrile/water) and its use as a sensor, no explicit numerical emission peak wavelength (λ_em,max) is provided in the given context chunks for either aggregated-state or solid/film conditions. Figures 1-4 show emission spectra but the peak values are not stated in the text. Therefore, both emission fields are set to null in strict adherence to the extraction rule requiring explicitly reported values.\"\n}\n```",
