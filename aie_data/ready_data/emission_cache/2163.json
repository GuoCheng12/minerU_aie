Table 1 reports λem[solid] = 415 nm for 2P-BTO. Figure 3C shows PL spectra in DMSO/water mixtures with increasing water fraction (fw), indicating aggregation-induced emission (AIE). However, the paper does not explicitly report a single emission peak wavelength for the aggregated state (e.g., 'λem,agg' or a value at a specific high fw like 90%). The narrative states fluorescence becomes stronger upon aggregate formation but does not give a numerical λmax for the aggregate. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per anti-leakage rule. Emission_solid_or_film_nm is taken from Table 1 for solid powder.\"\n}\n```",
