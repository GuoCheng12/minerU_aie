Aggregated-state emission peak (650 nm) is explicitly reported for DMSO/1,4-dioxane mixture with 90% poor solvent fraction, which is a clear aggregation condition. Solid-state emission peak (638 nm) is reported for ASCPI@starch microparticles, which are solid composite particles. The starch microparticles represent a solid-state environment, not a film, but meet the solid-state requirement. No thin film or pure powder data was found, but the composite microparticle emission qualifies as solid-state emission.\"\n}\n```",
