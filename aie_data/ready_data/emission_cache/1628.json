Figure 8 and accompanying text report emission of HPB in THF/water (fw=80%) at 334 nm, but this is for HPB, not TPE. The paper focuses on TPE-HPB adducts (1a-3c), not the standalone TPE molecule. Table 1 and spectral data are for the adducts. No standalone TPE emission data in aggregated state or solid/film is provided in the given context. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null (no explicit aggregate data for TPE itself), and emission_solid_or_film_nm is null.\"\n}\n```",
