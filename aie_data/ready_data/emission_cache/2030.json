However, no explicit emission peak values for TP6 are provided in the given context chunks. The text discusses emission maxima for other compounds (TP1, TP2, TP3, TP5, TP8) and mentions that TP4 and TP6 show blue-shifted spectra compared to TP2, but no numerical emission wavelength for TP6 is reported. Therefore, both emission fields are set to null. The aggregate emission condition is described for the series (DMSO/water v/v = 1/99), but no specific value for TP6 is given.\"\n}\n```",
