For aggregated-state emission: Figure 1A/B shows PL spectra in THF/water mixtures with increasing water fraction (fw), indicating aggregation at high fw. However, the text describes peak shifts and intensity changes but does NOT explicitly report a numerical emission maximum for the aggregated state (e.g., 'peaked at X nm in aggregates'). Therefore, emission_aggr_nm must be null. For solid/film emission: The text explicitly states 'emits with maximum peak at 460 nm in its solid state' (page 2) and 'pristine powders ... show a deep blue emission at 460 nm' (page 7). This qualifies as solid-state emission. No film-specific peak is given, so the solid-state value is used.\"\n}\n```",
