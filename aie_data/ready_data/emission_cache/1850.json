However, while the text discusses emission in aggregated states (THF/hexane mixtures with f_H=99%) and in thin films, it does not explicitly report the numerical emission peak wavelength (λ_em,max in nm) for either condition. Fig. 1 is referenced for PL spectra in THF/hexane mixtures, but the provided text only states the emission maximum is at 383 nm in pure THF, not in the aggregated state (f_H=99%). The text mentions emission intensity enhancement for thin films but does not give a peak wavelength. Therefore, both required numerical values are absent and must be set to null.\"\n}\n```",
