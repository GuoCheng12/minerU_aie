An explicit aggregate emission peak is not reported for C6 individually; the text states all complexes (C5-C10) emit at ~500 nm in DMF/water mixtures at fw=30% or 50%, but this is a general statement for the series, not a specific measured value for C6. A specific solid-state emission peak of 505 nm is reported for C6 powder in the high-pressure experiment (Fig. 5, page 4). Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per the anti-leakage rule.\"\n}\n```",
