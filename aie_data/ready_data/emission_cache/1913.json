However, no explicit emission peak for aggregated-state conditions (e.g., THF/water mixtures with high water fraction, labeled 'Em(agg)') is reported. The paper discusses AIE behavior in DMSO/toluene mixtures (Figure 1b,c) but does not provide a specific emission maximum for the aggregated state; it only shows trends in plots. No emission data for solid, powder, crystal, or thin film is reported. Therefore, both required emission values are null.\"\n}\n```",
