Emission in THF solution is reported at ca. 390 nm, but this is not an aggregate condition. The paper discusses aggregation-enhanced emission in THF/water mixtures (e.g., fw > 60%), but no explicit emission peak wavelength for TPP in the aggregated state is provided in the given context (only PL intensity trends are shown in Fig. 2). For solid/film, Fig. 4 and Table S1 (ESI) report the emission maximum of TPP in thin film as ca. 390 nm. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null due to lack of explicit aggregate emission peak data, while emission_solid_or_film_nm is extracted from the thin film measurement.\"\n}\n```",
