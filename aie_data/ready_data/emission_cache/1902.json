Emission in aggregated state is not explicitly reported as a peak wavelength from THF/water mixtures (only PL intensity trends are shown in Figure 2). The emission at 622 nm is explicitly stated for 'TPE-Th-B-doped AIE dots' in water (nanoparticles), which qualifies as a solid/film-like aggregated state (nanoparticles in aqueous suspension). This is extracted as emission_solid_or_film_nm. No explicit aggregate emission peak (e.g., from THF/water at high fw) is provided in numerical form, so emission_aggr_nm is set to null.\"\n}\n```",
