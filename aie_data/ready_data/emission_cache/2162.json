The paper discusses polymorphs 1b and 1c of THP-1 and their solid-state (crystal/powder/film) thermo-responsive emission, but no explicit aggregate-state emission peak (e.g., in THF/water mixture) is reported. Emission peaks for 1b (434 nm, 550 nm) and 1c (496 nm) are given for crystal samples under varying temperatures, but these are solid-state measurements, not aggregated-state conditions as strictly defined. Therefore, both emission_aggr_nm and emission_solid_or_film_nm are set to null because no single, definitive solid/film peak is reported independent of temperature variation, and no aggregate-condition peak is provided.\"\n}\n```",
