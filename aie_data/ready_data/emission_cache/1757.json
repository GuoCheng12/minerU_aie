Table 1 provides λPL(soln)=472 nm and λPL(film)=476 nm for Q-2-Py. The narrative on page 5 states: 'The quinoxaline-based compound Q-2-Py displayed a blue-shifted emission with a maximum peak at 476 nm in the solid state due to H-aggregation.' Figure 5 discusses THF/water mixtures for Q-2-Py, but no explicit aggregate emission peak value is reported in the provided text/table for the aggregated condition (only relative intensity plots are mentioned). Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per anti-leakage rule, as no explicit nm value for an aggregate condition (e.g., specific fw%) is given. emission_solid_or_film_nm is taken from the clearly reported film value.\"\n}\n```",
