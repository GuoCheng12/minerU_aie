However, no explicit emission peak wavelengths for aggregated-state or solid/film conditions were found in the provided content. The text mentions 'peak emission = 610 nm' in context of increasing EtOH fraction (poor solvent), but this appears to be a general statement about the series' AIE characteristics, not a specific reported value for TPE-4EP+ under defined aggregate conditions. No solid/film emission data is provided. Therefore, both emission fields are set to null per anti-leakage and strict extraction rules.\"\n}\n```",
