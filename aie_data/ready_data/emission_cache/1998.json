The emission from nanoparticles (NPs) at 540 nm (mentioned in Chunks 2 & 3) is also an aggregate condition (nanoaggregates), but the 537 nm value from the initial aggregate formation in THF/water is chosen as the primary aggregated-state emission peak as it is the first and clearest aggregate emission report.
