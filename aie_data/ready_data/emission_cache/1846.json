The text discusses fluorescence enhancement and emission at 515 nm/519 nm, but these are for the probe in PBS or artificial urine solution with added LPS, which is a specific sensing condition and not the general 'aggregated-state' (e.g., THF/water mixture) or 'solid/film' condition as strictly defined in the task.
