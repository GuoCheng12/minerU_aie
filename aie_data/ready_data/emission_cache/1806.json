The aggregated emission peak (~500 nm) is reported for the series in DMF/water mixtures at f_w=30% or 50%, satisfying the aggregate condition rule. No explicit solid-state or film emission maximum is given for C7 individually; the text mentions solid-state emission for the series in the range 500-535 nm (page 2), but this is a range, not a specific peak for C7, and it's described for 'solid states' generally, not specifically film. Therefore, emission_solid_or_film_nm is set to null.\"\n}\n```",
