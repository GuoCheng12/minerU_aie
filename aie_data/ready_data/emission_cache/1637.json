However, no explicit emission peak wavelength (in nm) is reported for aggregated-state conditions (e.g., THF/water mixture at specific fw) or for solid/film state. The text discusses PL intensity changes and spectral features in aggregates (e.g., 'PL intensity reaches its maximum at 90% water content') but does not state a numerical emission maximum wavelength under those conditions. Quantum yields are given for solid state (Table S1), but no solid-state emission peak is provided. Therefore, both required emission values are unavailable.\"\n}\n```",
