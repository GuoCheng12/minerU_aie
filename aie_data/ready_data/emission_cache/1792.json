For aggregated-state emission: The paper states that at fw = 50% in DMSO/water mixtures, an emission peak emerges at 511 nm, and molecular aggregation is explicitly mentioned as occurring at fw ≥ 50%. This qualifies as an explicit aggregate condition. For solid/film emission: Table 1 reports λem for 'Powder B' as 545 nm. Powder B is a crystalline solid (powder), qualifying as solid-state emission. The value 545 nm is not reused for the aggregate condition; the aggregate condition uses the 511 nm value from the solvent mixture experiment.\"\n}\n```",
