Emission_solid_or_film_nm = 445 nm is extracted from Chunk 3, which reports the emission of crystalline fibres (solid state). The film emission (499 nm) is not chosen as the solid/film value because the crystalline fibre value is explicitly given and is the 'bluer' solid-state emission referenced. The aggregated-state value is distinct from the solid-state value, adhering to the anti-leakage rule.\"\n}\n```",
