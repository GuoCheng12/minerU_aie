An aggregated-state emission peak is not reported under the strict definition (no explicit aggregate/aggregation condition like solvent mixtures causing aggregation). The paper discusses enhanced emission in high-viscosity glycerol/water mixtures, but this is attributed to restriction of intramolecular motion (RIM), not aggregation (explicitly states attempts to induce aggregation with THF/EtOH failed). Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null. A solid-state emission peak of ~575 nm is explicitly stated in the narrative on page 4 and corresponds to Fig. 2E.\"\n}\n```",
