This is a variant spelling of the target code 'TPB-CzC1'. Emission in aggregated state (THF/water mixtures) is discussed (Figures 3, S2) and a range of 409-422 nm is mentioned for the series, but no explicit peak value for TPBCzC1 under a defined high-water-fraction aggregate condition is provided in the given text. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per anti-leakage rule. A solid/film emission peak of 411 nm is explicitly reported for TPBCzC1 in vacuum-deposited neat film (Table 1, page 4).\"\n}\n```",
