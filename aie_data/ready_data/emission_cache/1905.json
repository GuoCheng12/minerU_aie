Figure 4(a) shows PL spectra of TPE-Se in THF/water mixtures, and the narrative discusses AIE behavior with increasing water fraction. However, no explicit emission peak wavelength (in nm) for the aggregated state (e.g., at fw=90%) is provided in the given text chunks. The text mentions emission peaks for TPE-Se NPs in water (551 nm in Chunk 9), but NPs are a prepared formulation with a polymer matrix, not the pure compound in an explicit aggregate condition like THF/water. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm cannot be assigned. No data for solid state, powder, or thin film of pure TPE-Se is reported; only nanoparticle (NP) data is given. Thus, emission_solid_or_film_nm is also null.\"\n}\n```",
