For aggregated-state emission: Figure 2A shows emission spectra in THF/water mixtures, with the plot in Figure 2B referencing intensity at 507 nm, which corresponds to the emission peak under high water fraction (fw=90%) aggregation conditions. For solid-state emission: Figure 3G shows PL spectra of as-prepared powders, with the text stating TPETPAN emits at 443 nm in its as-prepared solid state. The solid-state value is explicitly for powder, not film, but meets the 'solid or film' criteria. The aggregated emission is explicitly from a solvent mixture inducing aggregation (fw=90%).\"\n}\n```",
