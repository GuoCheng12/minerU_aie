No explicit aggregated-state emission peak (e.g., THF/water mixture) is reported for TPATPAN; only TPETPAN's aggregate emission in THF/water (fw=90%) is described (Figure 2). For TPATPAN, the solid-state emission maximum is given as 478 nm for the 'as prepared' powder in Figure 1 and page 4. The OLED EL peak at ~546 nm (page 5) is electroluminescence, not photoluminescence, and is not used. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is null due to lack of explicit aggregate condition data for TPATPAN.\"\n}\n```",
