Table 1 provides a solid-state emission peak (λem solid) of 419 nm for TPO-P. While the paper discusses aggregation (e.g., THF/hexane mixtures with hexane fraction f_H up to 90%) and shows PL spectra in Figure 1B, no explicit emission peak wavelength for the aggregated state is numerically reported in the provided text or table. The narrative mentions a blue shift of 23 nm upon aggregate formation from a solution peak of 442 nm, but the final aggregate peak value is not stated. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per the anti-leakage rule.\"\n}\n```",
