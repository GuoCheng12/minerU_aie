Table 1 provides a PL peak (λPL) of 570 nm for DPPM-SXAC measured in doped films, which qualifies as emission_solid_or_film_nm. While Figure 3C shows PL spectra of DPPM-SXAC in THF/water mixtures (aggregate conditions), the specific emission peak wavelength for the aggregated state (e.g., at high water fraction) is not explicitly reported in the provided text chunks; only a trend of blue-shift is mentioned. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per the anti-leakage rule.\"\n}\n```",
