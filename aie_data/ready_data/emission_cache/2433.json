For emission_aggr_nm: The paper states DPDPyE exhibits excimer emission at 523 nm in THF solution at 10^-8 M (Fig. 3B, page 2). While this is in solution, the text explicitly attributes this to excimer formation due to high concentration tendency and describes it as 'excimer emission' which is a form of aggregation at the molecular level. However, note: This is not the classic 'aggregate in poor solvent' condition. The strict definition for emission_aggr_nm requires an explicit aggregate condition (e.g., THF/water mixture). The paper also discusses aggregates in THF/water mixtures (Fig. 3D) but does not give a specific peak wavelength for DPDPyE in that condition. The 523 nm value is for concentrated solution excimer emission. Given the strict anti-leakage rule and the requirement for explicit aggregate keywords or solvent-mixture conditions, this value should be set to null. Re-evaluating: The paper's 'aggregate' discussion (page 3, chunk 6) is for THF/water mixtures, but no specific λmax is given for DPDPyE aggregates. The 523 nm is from solution excimer. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm = null. For emission_solid_or_film_nm: Table 1 gives 'Film' emission for DPDPyE as 503 nm, explicitly stated as spin-coated film. This qualifies.\"\n}\n```",
