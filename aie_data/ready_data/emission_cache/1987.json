The emission wavelength of 565 nm is reported for hydrogel G2 (formed with AIE-Y) in the fluorescence spectra (Figure S7). This qualifies as a solid-like/restricted environment (hydrogel) for emission_solid_or_film_nm. No explicit aggregate condition data (e.g., THF/water mixture) for the pure AIE-Y molecule is provided in the given context; only its emission within the hydrogel is reported. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null per the anti-leakage rule.\"\n}\n```",
