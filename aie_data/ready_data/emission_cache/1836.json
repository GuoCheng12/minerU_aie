No explicit aggregate emission peak (e.g., THF/water mixture at high fw) is reported for TB2FCN in the provided chunks. The paper discusses AIE behavior and shows PL spectra in THF/water mixtures for TBCN (Figure 2c) and mentions similar trends for TBFCN and TB2FCN (Figure S14), but no specific emission wavelength for TB2FCN in aggregated state (e.g., at fw=90%) is provided in the given text. Therefore, emission_aggr_nm is set to null. For solid/film, Table 1 reports 'Film' emission for TB2FCN as 650 nm. This is chosen over 'Crystal' (666 nm) per the rule to prefer film if available.\"\n}\n```",
