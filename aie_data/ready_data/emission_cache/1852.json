The paper discusses its AIE behavior in DMSO/water mixtures (Fig. S9) and states its emission is consistent with PASPy-al after reaction with Pd0 (501 nm). However, no explicit emission peak wavelength for PASPy under aggregated conditions (e.g., specific fw value) or in solid/film state is provided in the given context. The 501 nm value mentioned is for PASPy-al after reaction, not for PASPy itself in a defined aggregate or solid state. Therefore, both required emission values cannot be extracted and are set to null.\"\n}\n```",
