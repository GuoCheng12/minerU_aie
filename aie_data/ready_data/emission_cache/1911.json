However, while the paper discusses AIE properties and shows PL spectra in solvent mixtures (DMSO/Toluene, DMSO/Water), it does not explicitly report a single emission peak wavelength for an aggregated state (e.g., 'Em(agg)' or a peak at a specific high f_w). Figure 2C shows spectra in DMSO/Water mixtures, but no peak value is given in the text for the aggregated condition. The paper mentions a PLQY in 'thin film mode' but does not report the corresponding emission peak wavelength for the solid/film state. Therefore, both required emission values are unavailable under the strict extraction rules.\"\n}\n```",
